# Finding a Brand Voice

Content needs a voice. Without voice, it's only words on a screen.

But how do you find a voice for your company?

It comes down to brand persona.

Imagine your company is an actual person. What do they look like? What do they sound like? How do they interact with your customers?

Every piece of content you produce needs to resonate with your brand persona, carrying the same voice throughout.

Sometimes you create a brand new voice for the business entity. Sometimes you borrow the voice of a company leader, like the President, CEO, or Manager. Sometimes you need both.

Voice gives meaning. Voice builds connection and relationships. Voice turns a boring email update into an interesting note from a friend.

Voice is what gives your words power.
